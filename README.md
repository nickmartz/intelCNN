# intelCNN (Python)
In this project, I compared and contrasted the performance of an Alexnet, 3-layer CNN, and a 2-layer CNN on the [Intel Image Natural Scenes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification). Also, I explored the effects of different pooling functions and how it might effect the accuracy performance. Due to expensive/slow runtime, I decided to narrow down the dataset into 3 classes (forest, mountain, sea) which consisted of about 15,000 images. For more information, please refer to the PDF and code in this repository.
