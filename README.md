# intelCNN (Python)
In this project, I compared and contrasted the performance of an Alexnet, 3-layer CNN, and a 2-layer CNN on the [Intel Image Natural Scenes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification). Also, I explored the effects of different pooling functions, batch sizes, and epoch steps to determine if it had an effect on the accuracy. Due to expensive/slow runtime, I decided to narrow down the dataset into 3 classes (forest, mountain, sea) which consisted of about 8,500 images. Overall, I was able to obtain a pretty good accuracy of ~93/94% using the 3-layer CNN. For more information, please refer to the PDF and code in this repository.
